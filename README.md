# mroutes
## Purpose
A mini-server that link any machine in local network with any global machine over a simple protocol.
## How come?
Actually this function is performed over the 'ipv4 source port' space in the ipv4 packet.
I don't know if this utilitary will be useful, but maybe I use it in opencall project as the first layer.
